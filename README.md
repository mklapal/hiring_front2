# Instructions

As discussed I am sending you the description of the dev project. There is no time limit so you can send it back whenever you consider it done.

# Create a d3.js graph in existing js app
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Your task will be to create a data visualization in an existing Marionette application.
You can get the code from this repository and once you are done with it create pull request for this repo.

The application is a Contact Manager. When the user opens it in a browser, they land on a page listing the existing contacts. Each contact has a first name, last name and phone number. 

1. The user should be able to add the "gender" for each contact.

2. The user should be able to see a button "Gender graph", next to the "New contact" button on the landing page.

3. When the user clicks on the "Gender graph" button, they should be redirected to a new page.

4. The user should see a graph on the new page that visualizes the gender distribution. The graph could be one of following charts: pie chart, donut chart or bar chart. The chart should be built with d3.js library.

*Note:* The design of the chart is entirely up to you. Feel free to create it the way you find best.
Also nothing except the instructions here is strictly defined and you may use whatever you feel comfortable with it.

Hope you enjoy it :)

# Structuring Backbone Code with RequireJS and Marionette Modules

This code repository is the companion to my book on [using RequireJS with Marionette.js](https://leanpub.com/structuring-backbone-with-requirejs-and-marionette).

Even if you don't have the book, you can learn a lot from looking through the commit history. But if you're serious about wanting to become competent with RequireJS (and save time dealing with errors), I suggest you consider purchasing the book: typical mistakes and various tips, techniques, and explanations are indicated in the book and absent from this repository.
